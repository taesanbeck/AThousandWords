## Problem Statement
Assistive technology does not often receive the same amount of attention and resources as commercial applications of new technological developments. Novel techniques developed by researchers in the Natural Language Processing field have begun to be adapted for use in Computer Vision. Can new CV and NLP technologies be used to create new assistive technology to aid the visually impaired?

## Problem Objective
The team will develop a machine learning powered pipeline that, given an image, will describe it in detail so that a person can understand its content without having to see it. The description of the image includes objects, people, relative location, text, and background of the image. It will also describe faces, emotions, and activities where applicable.  
 
The project aims to create an ensemble and multimodal model for implementation of the feature recognition pipeline and subsequent description generation. The final product allows for an understandable description output from an image input, along with a text-to-audio output that assist the visually impaired in understanding the contents of an image.
